    <h1>Magneto(Max Eisenhardt)</h1>
    <p>Known by many names, Erik Magnus Lehnsherr is a powerful mutant willing to go to any extreme to protect his species as Magneto, the master of magnetism.[21] During his youth, he suffered atrocities at the hands of the Nazis in Auschwitz. After escaping, he learned at this cost of his own daughter's life that he had the mutant ability to generate and control magnetic fields, a condition that caused additional hate and fear from those who were different from him.[22] Being a target for so long and explicitly rejecting the possibility of any harmony with humans, Magneto aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as Homo superior, to become the dominant species on Earth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Seeking to subjugate humanity by brute force, he found himself in direct conflict with his former ally, Professor Charles Xavier and his X-Men, mutants who shared a dream of peaceful mutant-human coexistence.His reputation as an inspirational figurehead and a dangerous threat, as the leader of the Brotherhood and the Acolytes, granted him the rule over the nation of Genosha,until its destruction.Magneto has also had the X-Men as his allies on different occasions, expressing his intentions to try Xavier's way and even his students' perspective, by following Cyclops.</p>
