    <h1>Thanos</h1>
    <p>Thanos was one of the last sons of A'Lars, progenitor of the second colony of Eternals on Titan, and Sui-San, the last survivor of the original settlement of Eternals in this moon. 
    He was born with purple, hide-like skin and a massive body due to his Deviant Syndrome.The very first time his mother laid her eyes on the baby, she was driven mad and tried to kill him.
    After that, the Cosmic Ghost Rider from an alternate future came to kill the baby, but when the Penance Stare didn't work on Thanos, the Rider decided to take the baby under his wing and change the future.</p><br>
    <p>The Rider tried to convince Galactus to help him raise the baby, but the cosmic being refused and instead wanted to kill the baby himself.With the Watcher bearing witness, the Rider vowed to raise the baby on his own, creating an alternate timeline where Thanos grew to become an interplanetary dictator.
    The Guardians of the Galaxy of said timeline tried to prevent their future by stopping Frank, but he, and eventually baby Thanos, killed them all.</p> <br><p>They were subsequently greeted by Thanos' future self, who sported the same clothes Frank used as the Punisher.
    He brought both of them to his future, showing Frank the authoritarian world he had built on his example, including a past version of himself living with his wife Maria.
    Realizing the consequences of his intervention in his life, Frank killed the future Thanos and returned his baby self to the past, erasing the alternate timeline. 
    Death appeared before Frank to confirm that his actions had nonetheless instilled the baby Thanos with the bloodlust that would make him her agent.</p></div>
