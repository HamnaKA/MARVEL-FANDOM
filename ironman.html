    <h1>Iron Man (Anthony Tony Stark)</h1>
    <p>Tony Stark is a genius inventor and billionaire industrialist, who suits up in his armor of cutting-edge technology to become the super hero Iron Man. 
    The adopted son of weapons manufacturer Howard Stark,Tony inherited his family's company at a young age following his parents' death.
    While overseeing a manufacturing plant in a foreign country, Stark was kidnapped by local terrorists. Instead of giving in to his captors' demands to build weapons for them, Stark created a powerful suit of armor for himself to escape.
    Returning to America, Stark further upgraded the armor and put his vast resources and intellect to use for the betterment of the world as Iron Man.
    <p>Tony kept his alter-ego a secret for most of his career, juggling his responsibilities as head of Stark Industries while becoming a key player in the superhuman community as Iron Man and founding the world's premier super hero team, the Avengers.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    Over the years, Stark has faced numerous enemies, such as the Mandarin, Justin Hammer, Iron Monger, and the Titanium Man, as well as many personal demons, most notably his addiction to alcohol.
    For many years, Tony covered for his alter-ego by claiming that Iron Man was his anonymous bodyguard, but Tony eventually brought his dual identity to the public light.
    Recently, Tony escaped death by reconfiguring his body with a digital back-up of his mind, inadvertently causing him to become temporarily convinced that he was a clone of the real, late Tony Stark.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This resulted in Tony leading an army of artificial-life forms in a war against the anti-A.I. campaign of his adoptive brother Arno. After coming around to the fact that he was the real Tony Stark all along, Tony stopped Arno's deranged plan to enslave humanity to stop a non-existent alien threat,and he then opted to embark on a journey of self-discovery to escape the baggage of his career. 
    Stepping away from his high-tech lifestyle, Tony finds himself returning to his roots in an attempt to put back the "man" in Iron Man.</p>
