    <h1>Captain America(Steven Rogers)</h1>
    <p>
    Steve Rogers was born July 4, 1920, to poor Irish immigrant parents, Sarah and Joseph Rogers. Rogers grew up a frail youth during the Great Depression in New York City, New York. 
    Little else is known about Rogers' early life other than the fact that a strong sense of duty, honor, and humility was instilled in him; perhaps due to his Irish Catholic upbringing. 
    Rogers' father died when he was a child and his mother died from pneumonia later, when he was in his late teens. Steve used to go to a school in the Lower East Side neighborhood.</p>
    <br>
    Among the people responsible for instilling the patriotic values in him were his civics teacher Edna Crosley, who taught that as an American it was their responsibility to protect the United States which gave more rights than any other country in the world to its citizens.
    <p>
        <br>

     Rogers was then put through an intensive physical and tactical training program that taught him gymnastics, hand-to-hand combat from Colonel Rex Applegate and William Essart Fairbairn, and military strategy.
    Three months later, he was given his first assignment: to stop the Nazi agent called the Red Skull. To help him become a symbolic counterpart to the Red Skull, Rogers was given the red, white, and blue costume of Captain America.
    Rogers was also given the cover identity of a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh.</p>
    <br>


    <p>After successfully becoming Captain America, Rogers was later submitted to an experimental mind-conditioning program that conditioned his mind to accept false information about Walter Rogers' family on the chance he was captured by the enemy and forced to reveal classified information. 
    As part of the conditioning, Rogers believed his real name to be Grant Rogers, that he had a brother named Michael who had died at Pearl Harbor, and that due to his parents being diplomats, he had a casual upper-class appointment to the Army and Captain America position. 
    It would not be until far later in life that Rogers would recall the conditioning and his true history.</p>
